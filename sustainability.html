      </ul>
      <br />

        <li>Don't leave taps running when there is no use of them since you aren't using the water and it's all going to waste.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h4>Kitchen</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Only use dishwashers when they are full, and most dishwashers nowadays are good at cleaning soil, so you don't have to prewash them.</li>
        <li>Don't use running water to defrost/thaw meat or frozen foods, instead leave them overnight or use the defrost option in you microwave.</li>

        <li>Water the lawn in shorter periods but multiple times, rather than a long watering session.</li>
        <li>Cut the grass to the highest level in the lawn mover, which promotes root growth and is better at holding water in the soil.</li>
        <li>Check the sprinkers so that they are only watering to the lawn, and not paved surfaces.</li>
        <li>Set a timer whenever you are using manual sprinkers so that you don't forget to off them.</li>
      </ul>
